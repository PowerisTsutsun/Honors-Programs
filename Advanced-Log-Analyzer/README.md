### 🎯 How to Use
## 📝 1. Create a Sample Log File
Create a file named sample.log with some entries like this:


2025-02-22 10:00:00 192.168.1.1 Failed login attempt
2025-02-22 10:02:15 192.168.1.2 Unauthorized access detected
2025-02-22 10:05:30 192.168.1.3 Failed login attempt

Alternatively, create one using the command line:
echo "2025-02-22 10:00:00 192.168.1.1 Failed login attempt" > sample.log
echo "2025-02-22 10:02:15 192.168.1.2 Unauthorized access detected" >> sample.log


## 🚀 2. Run the Tool

✅ Batch Mode (Analyze Existing Logs)
Analyze the entire log file at once:
python main.py --logpath sample.log --mode batch


## ✅ Output Example:

Running in batch mode...
Threats detected:
 - 192.168.1.1 - Failed login attempt
 - 192.168.1.2 - Unauthorized access detected
Visual report saved as 'threat_report.png'.

## 🔄 Realtime Mode (Monitor Logs as They Update)
Continuously monitor a log file for new suspicious entries:
python main.py --logpath sample.log --mode realtime --alert

## ✅ Output Example:
Running in realtime mode...
Real-time threat detected: 192.168.1.1 - Failed login attempt
Alert sent for threat: 192.168.1.1 - Failed login attempt

Tip: In realtime mode, you can append new entries to sample.log in another terminal to simulate live monitoring.

## 🔔 3. Enable Alerts (Optional)
Use the --alert flag to receive notifications (printed alerts for now):


IN CMD ---> python main.py --logpath sample.log --mode batch --alert

## 📊 Visual Reports
The tool automatically generates a bar chart (threat_report.png) showing the count of threats by IP address.

## ✅ Example Visualization:

## 📊 Bar graph representing how many threats came from each IP.
The report is saved in the project directory.
## 🔑 Command-Line Arguments
Argument	Description	Example
--logpath	Path to the log file (required)	--logpath sample.log
--mode	batch (default) or realtime	--mode realtime
--alert	Enable alerts (optional)	--alert
