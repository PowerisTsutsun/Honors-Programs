## 💡 How It Works
Directory Listing Check:
Sends an HTTP GET request to check if the response contains "Index of /"—an indicator that directory listing is enabled.

## SQL Injection Test:
Appends a SQL payload (e.g., ' OR '1'='1) to the target URL and scans for error messages that might indicate a vulnerability. If a potential issue is detected, the tool provides recommendations such as using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## XSS Vulnerability Test:
Injects a script payload (e.g., <script>alert('xss')</script>) to see if it is reflected unescaped in the response, which would suggest an XSS vulnerability.

## Port Scanning:
Uses socket connections to check common ports (e.g., FTP, SSH, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS) and lists any that are open, giving you insight into potentially exposed services.

## Remediation Recommendations:
For each detected vulnerability, the tool prints out best practices and actionable steps to mitigate the risk.
